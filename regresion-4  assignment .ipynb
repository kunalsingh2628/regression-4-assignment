    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is its ability to automatically shrink the coefficients of irrelevant features to exactly zero. This leads to a sparse model where only a subset of the original features is retained, effectively performing feature selection. In situations where you have a large number of features, many of which may not contribute significantly to the predictive power of the model, Lasso can help simplify the model by excluding those less important features.\n",

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can be effective in handling multicollinearity in the input features. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. In the presence of multicollinearity, standard linear regression estimates can be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression handles multicollinearity through its feature selection property. Because of the L1 regularization term (sum of absolute values of coefficients), Lasso tends to shrink some coefficients exactly to zero during the optimization process. When coefficients are set to zero, the corresponding features are effectively excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature selection property is beneficial for dealing with multicollinearity because it automatically identifies and retains only a subset of relevant features, excluding redundant or highly correlated ones. Ridge Regression, which uses L2 regularization, also addresses multicollinearity but does not perform feature selection to the extent that Lasso does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity by providing a mechanism for automatic feature selection, which is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with correlated features."
